I am the director of the [Teaching and Learning Center](https://cuny.is/teaching) and a member of the doctoral faculty at the [CUNY Graduate Center](http://gc.cuny.edu). Trained as a historian, I wrote a dissertation about discourse around American adolescence in the years following World War II. My current research interests include college-level pedagogy, educational technology, open education, and critical university studies.

I design [institutes](https://tlc.commons.gc.cuny.edu/teachcuny-institutes/), teach [workshops](https://tlc.commons.gc.cuny.edu/workshop-archive/) and [interdisciplinary courses](https://critedtechsp23.commons.gc.cuny.edu/), and advise students in the [Interactive Technology and Pedagogy Certificate Program](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/interactive-technology-and-pedagogy) and the [M.A. Program in Digital Humanities](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/digital-humanities). I direct the [STEM Pedagogy Institute](http://cuny.is/spi), co-direct the [CUNY Humanities Alliance](https://cunyhumanitiesalliance.org/), and serve as Director of Community Projects for the [CUNY Academic Commons](http://cuny.is).  

I previously directed the [Center for Teaching and Learning](https://blogs.baruch.cuny.edu/ctl/) at Baruch College, where I designed the college's hybrid course development initiative, directed two open source software projects: [Blogs@Baruch](https://blogs.baruch.cuny.edu/) and [Vocat](https://vocat.io/), and taught courses in US History. I also worked with the [American Social History Project/Center for History and New Media](https://ashp.cuny.edu/) from 1999-2003, where I built [Virtual New York City](https://virtualny.ashp.cuny.edu/) and contributed to the [September 11 Digital Archive](https://911digitalarchive.org/).

From 2012-2022, I was a member of the editorial collective that oversees the [*Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy*](https://cuny.manifoldapp.org/journals/jitp). I have contributed essays to Matthew K. Gold’s [*Debates in the Digital Humanities*](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-88c11800-9446-469b-a3be-3fdb36bfbd1e/section/683df398-b766-41e0-9825-2247fc124f64#ch19) and, with Thomas Harbison, to Jack Dougherty and Kristen Nawrotzki’s [*Writing History in the Digital Age*](https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/xw42n885n?locale=en#/6/38[chp07]!/4/2/4[p97]/1:0).
